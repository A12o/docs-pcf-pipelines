This topic provides a description of the upgrade tile pipeline. 

## <a id='overview'></a>Overview

This pipeline supports patch upgrades of Elastic Runtime and service tiles.
Upgrade pipelines are intended to be kept running for as long as the foundation exists. 
Operators will need one pipeline per tile in your foundation, to keep every tile up to date.
It is important to note that the pipeline does not try to upgrade major or minor versions, only patch versions. 
For example, if a new release of a tile is released going from either --.n.-- to --.n+1.-- or n.--.-- to n+1.--.-- the pipeline will not upgrade to these tile versions. 
It will upgrade from --.--.n to --.--.n+1.

## <a id='usage'></a>Usage

1. Log in to Pivotal Network and download the latest version of PCF Platform Automation with Concourse (PCF Pipelines).
1. Locate the `upgrade-tile` subdirectory within the previously downloaded file.
1. (Optional) Configure Schedule.
   In the `pipeline.yml` there is a `schedule` resource pre-configured to trigger the pipeline in 30 minute intervals every day.

   The following parameters can be modified to achieve granular control  provide more fine grain control over when the pipeline upgrades the Elastic Runtime and service tiles:

   * `interval`: This controls how often the pipeline is triggered. Defaults to
   `30m`.
   * `start` and `stop`: This controls what times of the day the resource is
   allowed to trigger the pipeline. For example, if the pipeline should only
   run in the middle of the night this could be set to:

      ```
      start: "11:00 PM"
      stop: "1:00 AM"
      ```

      The above configuration would give a two hour window for the pipeline to
      check for new versions.

      Defaults to:

      ```
      start: "12:00 AM"
      stop: "11:59 PM"
      ```
   * `location`: This is the timezone for `start`, `stop`, and `days`. Defaults
   to `America/Los_Angeles`. 
   * `days`: This controls what days of the week the resource is allowed to trigger
   the pipeline. Defaults to every day.
