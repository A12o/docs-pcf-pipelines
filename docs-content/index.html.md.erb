This documentation details the benefits and available versions of PCF Pipelines. 

## <a id='overview'></a>Overview

PCF Pipelines are a collection of Concourse pipelines that install and upgrade Pivotal Cloud Foundry and its components. 
These pipelines are base templates meant to be modified. 
Operators utilize PCF Pipelines during Platform Dojos to automate the installing and upgrading of PCF. 

The `install-pcf` pipeline deploys PCF for the operator's chosen IaaS.
This pipeline installs Pivotal Cloud Foundry according to the [Reference Architecture](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/refarch/index.html) of your chosen IaaS. 
These architectures are suitable production environments, typically using three availability zones and high availability for components where possible.

The `upgrade-tile` pipeline supports patch upgrades of Elastic Runtime and service tiles.
 
## <a id='benefits'></a>Benefits

PCF Pipelines improve upon the manual experience of Installing and Upgrading PCF in the following ways:
  
  + PCF Pipelines allow operators to continuously deploy PCF while still maintaining previously configured pipeline modifications.
  + PCF Pipelines ensure that PCF platforms are more secure by applying a patch upgrade as soon as that patch is available on PivNet.


## <a id='support'></a> Supported Pipelines
The following pipelines are considered production-ready and are endorsed Pivotal Support:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>PCF Pipeline Name</th>
    <th>IAAS</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Install Pipeline (<code>install-pcf</code>)</td>
    <td><li>GCP (<code>gcp</code>)</li>
    <li>vSphere (<code>vsphere</code>)</li>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Upgrade Tile Pipeline (<code>upgrade-tile</code>)</td>

  </tr>
</table>

## <a id="reqs"></a>Prerequisites
The following are prerequisites for using PCF Pipelines:

+ Concourse server: Pivotal encourages operators to install Concourse by using [bosh-deploy](https://concourse.ci/clusters-with-bosh.html), as this is the only installation method endorsed by Pivotal Support.
+ Access to a source control repository, for example, git
+ Access to a Docker registry: Enabling tasks requires a Docker image, so as to instantiate a container. 
For more information on using Docker registries with PCF, see the [Using Docker Registries](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/opsguide/docker-registry.html) topic. 
+ Fly Command Line Interface (Fly CLI): This can be downloaded through the OS-specific link provided in the lower right hand corner of the Concourse user interface. For more information on using the Fly Command Line Interface, see the [Fly CLI](https://concourse.ci/fly-cli.html) documentation.
+ Firewall Provisions: Customers may have to configure open firewalls or proxies for the resources accessed by PCF Pipelines. For more information on when firewall provisions are needed, see the [Configuring Firewalls for PCF Pipelines](https://github.com/pivotal-cf/pcf-pipelines/blob/master/FIREWALL.md) topic.

## <a id='download'></a>Download PCF Pipelines
The most stable version of PCF Pipelines is available on [PivNet](https://network.pivotal.io/products/pcf-automation/). Each PCF Pipelines release contains bug fixes and new features.
Access to PCF Pipelines is restricted. 
Contact your account executive if you would like access to PCF Pipelines through PivNet. 

## <a id='install'></a>Install Pipelines
Install Pipelines deploy PCF for the operator's chosen IaaS. We currently only support vSphere</br></br>
For public cloud installs, such as GCP, the Install Pipeline deploys the necessary infrastructure in the public cloud. This infrastructure includes networks, load balancers, and databases. These resources are used to deploy Ops Manager and Elastic Runtime. </br></br>
On-premise private datacenter Install Pipelines, such as the vSphere Install Pipeline, do not provision any infrastructure resources.
The vSphere Install Pipeline only deploys Ops Manager and Elastic Runtime by using resources that are specified in the `params.yml` file of the vSphere pipeline folder.

The production-ready Install Pipelines are:

+ [vSphere Install Pipeline](vsphere-pipeline-install.html)
+ [GCP Install Pipeline](gcp-install-pipeline.html)

## <a id='upgrade'></a>Upgrade Tile Pipelines
These pipelines supports patch upgrades of Elastic Runtime and service tiles. These pipelines are intended to be kept running for as long as the deployment exists.</br> 
Upgrade pipelines check the Pivotal Network periodically for new software versions, and apply these updates to your foundation. 

The only production ready upgrade pipeline is the [Upgrade Tile Pipeline](upgrade-tile.html).
