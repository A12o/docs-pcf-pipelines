This documentation describes how to use PCF Pipelines to deploy PCF for vSphere.

## <a id='overview'></a>Overview
The vSphere install pipeline does not provision any infrastructure resources such as networks, loadbalancers, and databases.

## <a id='usage'></a>Usage
1. Log in to Pivotal Network and download the latest version of PCF Platform Automation with Concourse (PCF Pipelines).
1.	Unzip the compressed file.
1.	Locate the `install-pcf` sub-folder.
1.	Locate the `vspshere` sub-folder.
1.	Edit the `params.yml` file with your infrastructure details.
1.	Log in and target your Concourse server instance:
	`$ fly -t TARGET login --concourse-url TARGET-URL`
1.	Run the following commands:
	
	<code>	$ fly -t TARGET-NAME set-pipeline --pipeline PIPELINE-NAME --config PIPELINE-NAME/IAAS-NAME/pipeline.yml --load-vars-from PIPELINE-NAME/IAAS-NAME/params.yml</code>

	
	</br>Replace `PIPELINE-NAME` and `IAAS-NAME` with the parenthetical values provided in the [Currently Supported Pipelines](index.html#support) section of the PCF Pipelines Overview topic. 
1.	Navigate to the pipeline url and unpause the pipeline through the Concourse user interface. You can unpause the pipeline by running the following command:
	`$ fly -t TARGET-NAME unpause-pipeline --pipeline PIPELINE-NAME`

The first job will either trigger automatically or require manual intervention.
