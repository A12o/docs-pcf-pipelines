This documentation describes how to use PCF Pipelines to deploy PCF for vSphere.

## <a id='overview'></a>Overview
The vSphere install pipeline does not provision any infrastructure resources such as networks, loadbalancers, and databases.
The vSphere Install Pipeline deploys PCF using resources that are specified in the `params.yml` file.

## <a id='usage'></a>Usage
1. Log in to Pivotal Network and download the latest version of PCF Platform Automation with Concourse (PCF Pipelines).
1. Unzip the compressed file.
1. Locate the `install-pcf` sub-folder.
1. Locate the `vspshere` sub-folder.
1. Edit the `params.yml` file with your infrastructure details.
1. Log in and target your Concourse server instance:
	`$ fly -t TARGET login --concourse-url TARGET-URL`
1. Run the following commands:
	
	```
	$ fly -t yourtarget set-pipeline
	$ --pipeline PIPELINE-TYPE
	$ --config PIPELINE-TYPE/IAAS/pipeline.yml</br>
	$ --load-vars-from PIPELINE-TYPE-/IAAS/params.yml
	```
1. Navigate to the pipeline url and unpause the pipeline through the Concourse user interface. You can also run the following command to unpause the pipeline:
`$ fly -t TARGET-NAME unpause-pipeline --pipeline PIPELINE-NAME`

Depending on the pipeline, the first job will either trigger automatically or require manual intervention.
